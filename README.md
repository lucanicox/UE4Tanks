# UE4 Tanks Game

This is the first game I made using C++ in UE4. I made this game as a result of a course I did some time ago. I didn't want to make it exactly the same to the one on the course so I added the following features:

-New game mode based on a timer and score to determinate the level of difficulty (enemys spawn faster with a higer score).
-Added pickups for health, time, score and some power ups(triple shot and fire rate).
-Added a new enemy.

I still want to add more stuff but I'm working on another projects. You can check the game on https://lucanicox.itch.io/tankattack
